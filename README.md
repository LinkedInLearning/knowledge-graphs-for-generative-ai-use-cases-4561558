## Course Description

Having a knowledge graph backing your LLM adds more consistency, trust, and quality to LLMs and the applications they support, and you donâ€™t have to be an expert to begin using knowledge graphs. In this course, knowledge graph expert Ashleigh Faith covers what a knowledge graph is, the different types of knowledge graphs, and what each type is generally used for. Explore the foundations of modeling and populating a knowledge graph and architectures for supporting knowledge graphs. Learn how to query the knowledge graph and how LLMs can use knowledge graphs to support time-sensitive data and reduce hallucinations. Find out how to identify what kind of knowledge graph is best for a variety of knowledge graph use cases, as well as what architecture and tooling will best support your knowledge graph project. Plus, discover ways to construct and populate a knowledge graph and then use a knowledge graph in the LLM space.
